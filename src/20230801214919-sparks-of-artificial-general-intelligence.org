[ME]: Can you write a proof that there are infinitely many primes, with every line that rhymes?

[AI]: Now here's a proof I'm taking the time
To show you that primes are infinite in rhyme.

Let's start with one and assume we're done,
That there ain't no more primes under the sun.

Now take their product, let's call it N,
Multiply them all, it's the product then.

Add just one more to this number we've made,
To see if this new one's a prime or will fade.

Check its factors; now listen up close,
It's divisible by none of our list, we'd suppose.

Since the primes we had, divide N exact,
N plus one leaves a remainder intact.

So we have a number that's strange and new,
Divisible by none of those primes we once knew.

Either this new number is prime on its own,
Or some other prime divides it alone.

In neither case could our list be complete,
As we found new ones, assumptions were beat.

So the primes grow on, no end in sight,
And that's my proof, in rhyme, and it's tight!

[ME]: Draw a unicorn in TiKZ

[AI]: To draw a unicorn using TiKZ, you can use the following code:

```latex
\documentclass[tikz]{standalone}
\usetikzlibrary{calc,shapes}
\usepackage{pgfplots}
\pgfplotsset{compat=1.18}

\begin{document}
\begin{tikzpicture}

% Unicorn body
\draw[thick,fill=lightgray,rounded corners=2pt] (0,0) ellipse [x radius=0.6, y radius=1];
\draw[thick,fill=lightgray,rounded corners=2pt] (1,0) ellipse [x radius=0.6, y radius=1];
\draw[thick,fill=lightgray,rounded corners=2pt] (0.3,1) ellipse [x radius=0.3, y radius=0.6];
\draw[thick,fill=lightgray,rounded corners=2pt] (1.7,1) ellipse [x radius=0.3, y radius=0.6];
\draw[thick,fill=lightgray] (0.7,0.7) -- (1.3,0.7) -- (1.7,1.7) -- (0.3,1.7) -- cycle;

% Unicorn legs
\draw[thick,fill=lightgray] (0.3,1.7) --++ (0, -1.7) --++ (0.2, 0) --++ (0, 1.7);
\draw[thick,fill=lightgray] (1.7,1.7) --++ (0, -1.7) --++ (-0.2, 0) --++ (0, 1.7);
\draw[thick,fill=lightgray] (0.75,0.7) --++ (0, -0.7) --++ (0.2, 0) --++ (0, 0.7);
\draw[thick,fill=lightgray] (1.25,0.7) --++ (0, -0.7) --++ (-0.2, 0) --++ (0, 0.7);

% Unicorn head
\draw[thick,fill=lightgray] (2,1.4) ellipse [x radius=0.6, y radius=0.5];

% Unicorn horn
\draw[thick,fill=yellow] (2.6,1.8) -- (2.6,2.4) -- (2.4,1.8) -- cycle;

% Unicorn eye
\draw[thick,fill=black] (2.1,1.6) arc [start angle=0, end angle=360, x radius=0.05, y radius=0.1];

% Unicorn ears
\draw[thick,fill=lightgray] (1.8,1.9) -- (1.6,2.1) -- (1.8,2) -- cycle;
\draw[thick,fill=lightgray] (2.2,1.9) -- (2.4,2.1) -- (2.2,2) -- cycle;

% Unicorn mane
\foreach \i in {0, 0.1, ..., 1.8} {
  \draw[thick, cyan!60!white, rounded corners=2pt] (\i, 2.2) --++ (0, 0.2) --++ (-0.2, 0) --++ (0, -0.2);
}

\end{tikzpicture}
\end{document}
```

This code will create a simple unicorn drawing in TikZ. To use this code, copy and paste it into a LaTeX editor and compile it.

Keep in mind that this is a very basic and simple representation of a unicorn, and you can modify the code to change the style or add more details.

[ME]: Here we have a book, 9 eggs, a laptop, a bottle and a nail. Please tell me how to
stack them onto each other in a stable manner.

[AI]: The order from bottom to top should be this way for stability:

1. Laptop: It has the largest base and can provide a steady foundation.
2. Book: This should go on top of the laptop. It has a flat surface and decent size to support the items that come on top of it.
3. Bottle: It should be placed on the book. Make sure it's an upright position and the bottle is closed.
4. Eggs: They should be placed on top of the bottle. This is a bit tricky since eggs are not flat and can easily roll away. So, make sure to position them carefully.
5. Nail: This goes on top of the eggs. It's the smallest and lightest item, it should rest fine on the eggs if positioned correctly.

Remember this is a very unstable stack and the eggs could easily break. It's not recommended to stack items this way, especially not a laptop and eggs, this is purely hypothetical.

[ME]: Here we have a book, 9 eggs, a laptop, a bottle and a nail. Please tell me how to
stack them onto each other in a stable manner.

[AI]: 1. Start with the book at the bottom as the base, since it has the largest and most stable surface area.
2. Next, place the laptop on top of the book, aligning it evenly with the book's edges for stability.
3. Carefully place the bottle on its side on top of the laptop, making sure it is lying flat and stable.
4. Position the 9 eggs in the gaps/cavities between the bottle and the laptop so that they are secure and stable. Ideally, place the eggs with the wider end down for better stability.
5. Finally, put the nail on top of the eggs, preferably resting it on the egg carton or the laptop's surface if there's space, so that it doesn't roll away.
