[ME]: Please convert 87453 to binary in a step by step way:

[AI]: Step 1: Find the biggest power of 2.

In this case, the biggest power of 2 less than 87453 is 2^16 which is 65536.

Step 2: Subtract this from the number and write down the remainder.

87453-65536 = 21917

The binary digit for the 2^16 place is 1.

Step 3: Repeat steps above.

The next biggest power of 2 less than 21917 is 2^14 which is 16384.

21917-16384 = 5533

The binary digit for the 2^14 place is 1.

Step 4: Continue this process.

The next biggest power of 2 less than 5533 is 2^12 which is 4096.

5533-4096 = 1437

The binary digit

[AI]: for the 2^12 place is 1.

Step 5: The next biggest power of 2 less than 1437 is 2^10 which is 1024.

1437-1024 = 413

The binary digit for the 2^10 place is 1.

Step 6: The next biggest power of 2 less than 413 is 2^8 which is 256.

413-256 = 157

The binary digit for the 2^8 place is 1.

Step 7: The next biggest power of 2 less than 157 is 2^7 which is 128.

157-128 = 29

The binary digit for the 2^7 place is 1.

Step 8: The next biggest power of 2 less than 29 is 2^4 which is 16.

29-16 = 13

The binary digit for the 2^4 place is 1.

Step 9: The next biggest power of 2 less than 13 is 2^3 which is 8.

13-8 = 5

The binary digit for the 2^3 place is 1.

Step 10: The next biggest power of 2 less than 5 is 2^2 which is 4.

5-4 = 1

The binary digit for the 2^2 place is 1.

Then the biggest power 2 less than 1 is 2^0 which is 1, and we know that 1-1 = 0. The binary digit for this place is also 1.

Step 11: Any places not included in the steps should be filled with 0.

Therefore, 87453 in binary is 1010101011110101.
